### Description
"Shut the Box" is a dice game (gambling often being involved) in which a player is given a box with 9 uncovered tiles and continually rolls dice and covers any tiles that add up to the sum of the dice. If you roll the dice and there is no combination of tiles that add up to the dice total, then your game is over and you sum the uncovered tiles for your score. If you successfully cover all of the tiles, then you win; you have shut the box!

### Rules
Here are the rules:
1. Rolling: you must roll two dice if the 7, 8, and 9 tiles are still uncovered. You may roll either one or two dice if the 7, 8, and 9 tiles are all covered.
2. After rolling: sum up the total of your dice roll and choose a combination of uncovered tiles to cover that add up to your dice total. Example when 5 is rolled: you can cover any one of these combinations:
- combo 1
- combo 2
3. Continue
